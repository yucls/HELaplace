 The algorithm of paper--Mineral Identification Based on Deep Learning Using Image Luminance Equalization
Where hisEqulColor1 represents the global histogram equalization algorithmï¼ŒhisEqulColor2 represents the adaptive histogram equalization algorithm.Users can choose by themselves according to their needs.We also have gamma alogorithm.
dst1 represents the fused image,you can modify the fusion proportion as needed.
